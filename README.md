**Stalwart SMTP** is a modern SMTP server developed in Rust with a focus on security, speed, and extensive configurability. 
It features built-in DMARC, DKIM, SPF and ARC support for message authentication, strong transport security through DANE, MTA-STS and SMTP TLS reporting, and offers great flexibility and customization thanks to its dynamic configuration rules and native support for Sieve scripts.

Key features:

- Sender and Message Authentication:
  - Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (**DMARC**) verification and failure/aggregate reporting.
  - DomainKeys Identified Mail (**DKIM**) verification, signing and failure reporting.
  - Sender Policy Framework (**SPF**) policy evaluation and failure reporting.
  - Authenticated Received Chain (**ARC**) verification and sealing.
  - Reverse IP (**iprev**) validation.
- Strong Transport Security:
  - DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (**DANE**) Transport Layer Security.
  - SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (**MTA-STS**).
  - SMTP TLS Reporting (**TLSRPT**) delivery and analysis.
- Inbound Filtering and Throttling:
  - Sieve scripting language with support for all [registered extensions](https://www.iana.org/assignments/sieve-extensions/sieve-extensions.xhtml).
  - **Milter** support for integration with external content filtering systems such as SpamAssassin and ClamAV.
  - Address rewriting.
  - Filtering, modification and removal of message parts or headers.
  - Inbound concurrency & rate limiting.
- **Spam and Phishing** filter:
  - Comprehensive set of filtering **rules** on par with popular solutions.
  - Statistical **spam classifier** with automatic training capabilities.
  - DNS Blocklists (**DNSBLs**) checking of IP addresses, domains, and hashes.
  - Collaborative digest-based spam filtering with **Pyzor**.
  - **Phishing** protection against homographic URL attacks, sender spoofing and other techniques.
  - Trusted **reply** tracking to recognize and prioritize genuine e-mail replies.
  - Sender **reputation** monitoring by IP address, ASN, domain and email address.
  - **Greylisting** to temporarily defer unknown senders.
  - **Spam traps** to set up decoy email addresses that catch and analyze spam.
- Flexible Queues:
  - Distributed and fault-tolerant queues.
  - Unlimited virtual queues with custom routing rules.
  - Delayed delivery with `FUTURERELEASE` and `DELIVERBY` extensions support.
  - Priority delivery with `MT-PRIORITY` extension support.
  - Outbound throttling & Disk quotas.
- Logging and Reporting:
  - Detailed logging of SMTP transactions and events, including delivery attempts, errors, and policy violations.
  - Integration with **OpenTelemetry** to enable monitoring, tracing, and performance analysis of SMTP server operations.
  - Automatic analysis of incoming DMARC/TLS aggregate reports, DMARC/DKIM/SPF authentication failure reports as well as abuse reports.
- And more:
  - SASL authentication.
  - Redis, LDAP, PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite support.
  - Email aliases, mailing lists, subaddressing and catch-all addresses support.
  - Granular configuration rules.
  - REST API for management.
  - Memory safe (thanks to Rust).
